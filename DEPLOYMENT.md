# Dokploy Deployment Guide

## ✅ Environment Variable Setup (COMPLETED)

You've correctly configured:

- **Environment Variable:** `VITE_RAWG_API_KEY=5dfbe1e4a94847cf94ce53b04b84f90f`
- **Build-Time Variable:** ✅ Enabled in Dokploy

The API key is now working! Console shows successful API calls.

## ⚠️ Current Issue: DNS Resolution for `media.rawg.io`

Your deployment is successfully fetching game data from RAWG API, but the browser cannot load images from `media.rawg.io` due to DNS resolution failure:

```
GET https://media.rawg.io/media/games/... net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

### Possible Causes

1. **Client-side DNS issue**: The user's browser or network can't resolve `media.rawg.io`
2. **Firewall/Content filter**: Your server/network may block `media.rawg.io`
3. **CORS policy**: Browser security blocking cross-origin image loads (unlikely)

### Debugging Steps

1. **Test DNS resolution** on your deployment server:

   ```bash
   nslookup media.rawg.io
   ping media.rawg.io
   ```

2. **Test from your local browser**:
   Open your deployed site on a different network (mobile hotspot, etc.)

3. **Check if it's a DNS propagation issue**:
   Use Google DNS: https://dns.google/query?name=media.rawg.io

### Quick Fix: Proxy Images Through Your Backend (Recommended)

Since this is a free public API key (not a secret), the DNS issue might be intermittent or location-specific. However, if you want bulletproof image loading, consider adding a backend proxy route to fetch images server-side.

### Alternative: Use Cloudflare or Vercel Edge

Deploy through a service with better DNS resolution and edge caching.

## Verification

✅ **API Integration:** Working  
✅ **Environment Variables:** Configured correctly  
⚠️ **Image Loading:** DNS resolution issue with `media.rawg.io`

The console logs show the complete flow is working - it's just the final image download that's failing due to DNS.
